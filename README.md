## Projects
1. ### [Algorithm for stock market analysis](https://github.com/01ritvik/Stock-trading-algorithm)
- Crafted an innovative stock forecasting algorithm that leverages state-of-the-art metrics and analysis methodologies. This algorithm integrates a comprehensive array of data sources, including historical pricing trends, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis derived from financial news, to generate precise predictions of stock market movements..

2. ### [TSP Evolved: A Bio-Inspired Approach with ACO and Cheapest Links](https://github.com/01ritvik/TSP-evolved)
- In addressing the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), this project adopts a hybrid strategy that marries the ingenuity of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)—a technique inspired by the foraging behavior of ants—with the efficiency of the Cheapest Link Algorithm. By harnessing the principles of graph theory, this approach effectively navigates the NP-hard challenges of the TSP, paving the way for the optimization of city routes in a manner that is both cost-effective and efficient.

3. ### [Whatsapp AI Chatbot](https://github.com/01ritvik/whatsapp-chatbox)
- Engineered a sophisticated WhatsApp chatbot that excels in processing and archiving incoming messages. This bot is designed with advanced rule-based algorithms, enabling it to respond intelligently to messages according to a set of predefined parameters. Its deployment automates interactions on the WhatsApp platform, significantly enhancing the user experience and operational efficiency.

4. ### [Android Malware Detector](https://github.com/01ritvik/Android-Malware-Detector-)
-  Led a cutting-edge Python project that refined data processing techniques for a vast dataset, aimed at detecting Android malware. This project stood out by merging diverse classification methods, including **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**, **decision trees**, and **neural networks**, to discover an optimal model. This breakthrough model was then operationalized, significantly enhancing the Android malware detection framework with its advanced capabilities.

6. ### [WhatsApp Chat Automation](https://github.com/01ritvik/whatsapp-automation)
- Using **SQL** and **Python**, created an automated WhatsApp messaging program that integrates database information to allow for user-friendly entry of recipient details. This permits message delivery at any time, without the requirement for direct phone engagement.
